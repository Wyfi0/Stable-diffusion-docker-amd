# Stable diffusion docker container
These are my Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml for my AMD graphics card (6700xt)

------------------

I made this because I wanted to learn more about docker and building custom images. I also made this because I couldn't get any other "stable-diffusion-docker" containers to work for some reason, so I started from scratch.
